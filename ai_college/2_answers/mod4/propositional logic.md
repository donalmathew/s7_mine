Propositional logic is the simplest form of logic, dealing with statements that are either true or false.

Basic components:
- Atomic propositions: Simple statements (P, Q, R...)
- Logical operators: 
  - AND (∧)
  - OR (∨)
  - NOT (¬)
  - IMPLIES (→)
  - EQUIVALENT (↔)

Example:
```
P: "It is raining"
Q: "The ground is wet"

Statement: P → Q
Meaning: "If it is raining, then the ground is wet"
```

Truth Tables:
```
P | Q | P∧Q | P∨Q | P→Q
T | T |  T  |  T  |  T
T | F |  F  |  T  |  F
F | T |  F  |  T  |  T
F | F |  F  |  F  |  T
```
