**IMPLEMENT LEXICAL ANALYSER**

  

AIM

Implement lexical analyser using lex tool.

  

ALGORITHM

  

1. Start
    
2. Open the file input.c in read mode
    
3. If the file is not found . Display an error message
    
4. Else scan and analyse each component ch until the end of file
    

If ch is a keyword display ‘kwd’

If ch is an identifier display ‘id’

If ch is any arithmetic operator display ‘op-plus/sub/div/mul..’

If ch is any other operators display the same

  

5. Close the file
    
6. Stop
    

  


```


Here's your code with a detailed explanation of its functionality, along with an algorithm that outlines the steps taken by the program. This code defines a lexical analyzer using Flex (or Lex) that processes a source code file to identify various tokens such as digits, keywords, operators, symbols, logical operators, relational operators, identifiers, and the main function.

### Algorithm

1. **Include Necessary Libraries**:
   - Include standard input/output library for printing.

2. **Define Token Patterns**:
   - Define regular expressions for different token types:
     - **Digits**: One or more numeric characters.
     - **Keywords**: Specific reserved words in the language (e.g., `int`, `char`, etc.).
     - **Operators**: Arithmetic symbols (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
     - **Symbols**: Special characters like `;`, `,`, and `"`.
     - **Logical Operators**: Logical AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`).
     - **Relational Operators**: Comparison operators like `<`, `>`, `<=`, etc.
     - **Identifiers**: Variable names starting with a letter followed by letters or digits.
     - **Main Function**: The specific function name `main()`.

3. **Define Actions for Each Token**:
   - For each token pattern defined, specify an action to take when that pattern is matched (in this case, print the token type and its value).

4. **Main Function Implementation**:
   - Open the input file specified as a command line argument.
   - If the file opens successfully, set it as the input stream for the lexer and call the lexer function (`yylex()`).

5. **End-of-Input Handling**:
   - Define a function (`yywrap()`) to handle end-of-input situations.

### C Code

Here’s the complete code with comments included:

```c
%{
    #include<stdio.h>  // Include standard input/output library
    FILE *fp;         // File pointer for reading input files
%}

// Define patterns for different tokens
digit        [0-9]+  // Pattern to match one or more digits
keyword      [\t]*"int"|[\t]*"char"|[\t]*"float"|[\t]*"for"|[\t]*"while"|[\t]*"else"|[\t]*"if"|[\t]*"break"|[\t]*"case"  // Keywords in C programming
operator     "+"|"-"|"*"|"/"  // Arithmetic operators
symbol       ";"|","|"\""  // Symbols like semicolon, comma, and double quotes
logicoptr    "&&"|"||"  // Logical operators (AND, OR)
relationoptr [\t]*"<="|">="|"++"|"!="|"<"|">"|"="  // Relational operators (less than, greater than, etc.)
identifier   [a-z]+[a-z0-9]*  // Identifiers starting with a letter followed by letters or digits
main         "main()"  // Pattern to match the main function declaration

%%

// Actions to perform when a pattern is matched
{digit}        {printf("\n    numbers        ::%s", yytext);}  // Print matched numbers
{keyword}      {printf("\n    keyword        ::%s", yytext);}  // Print matched keywords
{operator}     {printf("\n    operator       ::%s", yytext);}  // Print matched operators
{symbol}       {printf("\n    symbol         ::%s", yytext);}  // Print matched symbols
{logicoptr}    {printf("\n    logicoptr     ::%s", yytext);}  // Print matched logical operators
{relationoptr} {printf("\n    relationoptr   ::%s", yytext);}  // Print matched relational operators
{identifier}   {printf("\n    identifier     ::%s", yytext);}  // Print matched identifiers
{main}         {printf("\n    main          ::%s", yytext);}  // Print matched main function declaration
.              {}  // Ignore any other character (not defined in patterns)

%%

// Main function where execution starts
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    fp = fopen(argv[1], "r");  // Open the file specified in command line argument for reading
    if (fp != NULL) {          // Check if the file was opened successfully
        yyin = fp;             // Set the input stream for the lexer to the opened file
        yylex();               // Call the lexer to start processing the input file
    }
    return(0);                 // Return 0 indicating successful execution
}

// Function to handle end of input for the lexer
int yywrap() {
    return(1);                // Return 1 to indicate that there are no more files to process
}
```

### Explanation of Key Components:

1. **Token Definitions**:
   - Regular expressions are defined for various token types that will be recognized by the lexer.

2. **Actions**:
   - Each token has an associated action that specifies what happens when that token is recognized. In this case, it prints out the type of token and its value.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads from a file specified on the command line, allowing it to process any source code provided in that file.

4. **Main Functionality**:
   - The main function initializes file handling and invokes the lexer to process tokens until EOF is reached.

5. **Error Handling and Ignoring Characters**:
   - The rule `.` is used to ignore any characters not defined in previous patterns.

### Example Usage:

To use this program:

1. Save it in a file named `lexer.l`.
2. Compile it using Flex (or Lex) and GCC:
   ```bash
   flex lexer.l          # Generate lex.yy.c from lexer.l
   gcc lex.yy.c -o lexer -lfl # Compile lex.yy.c into an executable named 'lexer'
   ```
3. Run it with an input file containing C-like code:
   ```bash
   ./lexer input.txt     # Replace 'input.txt' with your actual input file name.
   ```

This program serves as a basic lexical analyzer that can be extended or modified to include additional tokens or functionality as needed for specific programming languages or requirements.
```c
%{
    #include<stdio.h>  // Include standard input/output library for printf function
    FILE *fp;        // Declare a file pointer to handle file operations
%}

// Define patterns for different tokens
digit        [0-9]+  // Pattern to match one or more digits
keyword      [\t]*"int"|[\t]*"char"|[\t]*"float"|[\t]*"for"|[\t]*"while"|[\t]*"else"|[\t]*"if"|[\t]*"break"|[\t]*"case"  // Keywords in C programming
operator     "+"|"-"|"*"|"/"  // Arithmetic operators
symbol       ";"|","|"\""  // Symbols like semicolon, comma, and double quotes
logicoptr    "&&"|"||"  // Logical operators (AND, OR)
relationoptr [\t]*"<="|">="|"++"|"!="|"<"|">"|"="  // Relational operators (less than, greater than, etc.)
identifier   [a-z]+[a-z0-9]*  // Identifiers starting with a letter followed by letters or digits
main         "main()"  // Pattern to match the main function declaration

%%

// Actions to perform when a pattern is matched
{digit}        {printf("\n    numbers        ::%s",yytext);}  // Print matched numbers
{keyword}      {printf("\n    keyword        ::%s",yytext);}  // Print matched keywords
{operator}     {printf("\n    operator       ::%s",yytext);}  // Print matched operators
{symbol}       {printf("\n    symbol         ::%s",yytext);}  // Print matched symbols
{logicoptr}    {printf("\n    logicoptr     ::%s",yytext);}  // Print matched logical operators
{relationoptr} {printf("\n    relationoptr   ::%s",yytext);}  // Print matched relational operators
{identifier}   {printf("\n    identifier     ::%s",yytext);}  // Print matched identifiers
{main}         {printf("\n    main          ::%s",yytext);}  // Print matched main function declaration
.              {}  // Ignore any other character (not defined in patterns)

%%

// Main function where execution starts
int main(int argc,char *argv[])
{
    fp=fopen(argv[1],"r");  // Open the file specified in command line argument for reading
    if(fp!=NULL)            // Check if the file was opened successfully
    {
        yyin=fp;           // Set the input stream for the lexer to the opened file
        yylex();           // Call the lexer to start processing the input file
    }
    return(0);              // Return 0 indicating successful execution
}

// Function to handle end of input for the lexer
int yywrap()
{
    return(1);             // Return 1 to indicate that there are no more files to process
}
```

```
Explanation of Key Components:

1. **Lexical Patterns**: The code defines various patterns using regular expressions to identify different types of tokens in C-like programming languages.

2. **Actions**: Each pattern is associated with an action that specifies what should happen when a token is recognized. In this case, it prints the type of token along with its value.

3. **Main Function**: The `main` function opens a file for reading based on user input and initiates lexical analysis by calling `yylex()`.

4. **End of Input Handling**: The `yywrap` function is called when the lexer reaches the end of input, signaling that there are no more files to process.

This code is typically part of a lexical analyzer generated by tools like Flex or Lex, which are used in compiler design.
