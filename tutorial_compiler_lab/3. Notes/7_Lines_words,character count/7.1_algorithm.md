Hereâ€™s your code with detailed comments explaining each part of the program. This code is a lexical analyzer that counts lines, words, and characters in a given text file.

```c
%{
    #include<stdio.h>  // Include standard input/output library for printf function
    int lines = 0, words = 0, characters = 0, in_word = 0;  // Initialize counters for lines, words, characters, and in-word flag
%}

%%

// Define patterns and actions for counting

[\n]        {lines++; characters++; in_word = 0;}  // On newline character: increment line count and character count; reset in-word flag
[\t]        {characters += yyleng; in_word = 0;}    // On tab character: increment character count by length of tab; reset in-word flag
[ ]         {characters++; in_word = 0;}            // On space character: increment character count; reset in-word flag
[^\t\n]     {characters += yyleng; if (!in_word) {words++; in_word = 1;}}  // For any other character: increment character count by length; if not already in a word, increment word count and set in-word flag
.           {characters++;}                          // For any other single character (not matched above): just increment character count

%%

// Main function where execution starts
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    FILE *file = fopen(argv[1], "r");  // Open the file specified in command line argument for reading
    if (!file)                          // Check if the file was opened successfully
    {
        printf("File not Found!");     // Print error message if file not found
        return 1;                       // Return with error code
    }
    
    yyin = file;                       // Set the input stream for the lexer to the opened file
    yylex();                           // Call the lexer to start processing the input file
    
    // Output the counts of lines, words, and characters
    printf("\nLines: %d\n", lines);
    printf("\nWords: %d\n", words);
    printf("\nCharacters: %d\n", characters);
    
    fclose(file);                      // Close the opened file
    return 0;                          // Return 0 indicating successful execution
}

// Function to handle end of input for the lexer
int yywrap()
{
    return 1;                         // Return 1 to indicate that there are no more files to process
}

/*
I/P:  Hello world
      this is an example
o/p:  Lines: 2
      Words: 6
      Characters: 30
*/
```

### Explanation of Key Components:

1. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `lines`, `words`, `characters`: Counters to keep track of the number of lines, words, and characters.
   - `in_word`: A flag to track whether the lexer is currently inside a word.

2. **Lexical Rules**:
   - The rules define how different types of characters are processed:
     - Newline (`\n`): Increments both line and character counts.
     - Tab (`\t`): Increments the character count by the length of the tab (typically treated as multiple spaces).
     - Space (` `): Increments the character count and resets the word flag.
     - Non-whitespace characters (`[^\t\n]`): Increments character count and checks if it marks the start of a new word.
     - Any other character (`.`): Simply increments the character count.

3. **Main Function**:
   - Opens a specified file for reading.
   - Calls `yylex()` to start processing input.
   - Outputs the total counts after processing.

4. **End-of-Input Handling**:
   - The `yywrap` function indicates that there are no more files to process when called.

This code effectively counts lines, words, and characters from a text file and provides a simple demonstration of lexical analysis using Flex or Lex.
