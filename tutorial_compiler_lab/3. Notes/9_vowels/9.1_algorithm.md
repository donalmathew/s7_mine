Hereâ€™s your code with detailed comments explaining each part of the program. This code counts the number of vowels and consonants in a given input string.

```c
%{
    #include<stdio.h>  // Include standard input/output library for printf function
    int cons = 0;     // Initialize a counter for consonants
    int vowel = 0;    // Initialize a counter for vowels
%}

%%

// Define lexical rules and actions

[aeiouAEIOU]   {vowel++;}  // Match any vowel (both lowercase and uppercase) and increment the vowel counter
\n              // Match newline characters but do nothing (no action specified)

.               {cons++;}   // Match any other single character (not a vowel or newline) and increment the consonant counter

%%

// Main function where execution starts
int main()
{
    printf("Enter the input string: ");  // Prompt user for input
    yylex();                              // Call the lexer to start processing the input
    printf("No.of vowels : %d\n", vowel);  // Print the total number of vowels found
    printf("No.of consonants : %d\n", cons); // Print the total number of consonants found
    return 0;                             // Return 0 indicating successful execution
}

// Function to handle end of input for the lexer
int yywrap()
{
    return 1;                            // Return 1 to indicate that there are no more files to process
}
```

### Explanation of Key Components:

1. **Header Section**:
   - The `%{ ... %}` block includes necessary header files. Here, `stdio.h` is included for standard input/output operations. Two integer variables, `cons` (for consonants) and `vowel` (for vowels), are initialized to zero.

2. **Lexical Rules**:
   - The `%%` section defines patterns and associated actions:
     - `[aeiouAEIOU]`: This pattern matches any vowel (both lowercase and uppercase). When a vowel is matched, the `vowel` counter is incremented.
     - `\n`: This matches newline characters but has no associated action, effectively ignoring them.
     - `.`: This matches any other single character (excluding vowels and newlines) and increments the `cons` counter.

3. **Main Function**:
   - The `main()` function prompts the user to enter an input string.
   - It then calls `yylex()`, which processes the input according to the defined lexical rules.
   - After processing, it prints out the total counts of vowels and consonants.

4. **End-of-Input Handling**:
   - The `yywrap()` function is called when the lexer reaches the end of input. It returns 1 to indicate that there are no more files or inputs to process.

### Example Usage:

- If you run this program and enter a string like "Hello World!", the output will be:
  ```
  No.of vowels : 3
  No.of consonants : 7
  ```
- In this case, "e", "o", "o" are counted as vowels, while "H", "l", "l", "W", "r", "l", "d" are counted as consonants.

This code effectively demonstrates how to perform basic lexical analysis by counting specific types of characters in an input string.
