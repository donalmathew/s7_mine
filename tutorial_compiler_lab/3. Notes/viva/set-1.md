Here are the answers to your compiler design lab viva questions:

### 1. **What is Handle Pruning?**  
   - Handle pruning refers to the process of identifying the **handle** (the substring that matches the right-hand side of a production) in a sentential form during **shift-reduce parsing** and reducing it to the corresponding non-terminal. This continues until the start symbol is reached.

---

### 2. **What is Context Free Grammar?**  
   - A **Context Free Grammar (CFG)** is a set of production rules that describe all possible strings in a language. Each production rule maps a **non-terminal** to a string of terminals and/or non-terminals.  
   **Example:**  
   ```
   S → aSb | ε
   ```
   - Here, `S` is a non-terminal, and `a` and `b` are terminals.

---

### 3. **What is Ambiguous Grammar?**  
   - A grammar is **ambiguous** if there exists **more than one parse tree** for the same input string or **more than one leftmost or rightmost derivation**. Ambiguity makes it challenging to parse the language correctly.

---

### 4. **Why y.tab.h is used?**  
   - `y.tab.h` is a header file generated by **YACC** (Yet Another Compiler Compiler). It contains **token definitions** used by both `yacc` and `lex` to maintain consistency between them during lexical and syntax analysis.

---

### 5. **Disadvantages of Top-Down Parser**  
   1. **Backtracking**: May require backtracking for certain inputs, leading to inefficiency.
   2. **Cannot handle left recursion**: It fails to parse grammars with **left-recursive rules**.
   3. **Limited power**: It can only parse **LL(k)** grammars, which are less expressive than **LR(k)** grammars.

---

### 6. **What is Lex Tool?**  
   - **Lex** is a lexical analyzer generator used to create programs that perform **lexical analysis**. It converts input character streams into **tokens**.  
   - Example usage: Tokenizing keywords, operators, or identifiers in source code.

---

### 7. **What is Yacc?**  
   - **YACC** (Yet Another Compiler Compiler) is a **parser generator** that produces a **syntax analyzer** from a given **grammar specification**. It works with Lex to build compilers and interpreters.

---

### 8. **What are Error Recovery Strategies?**  
   1. **Panic Mode Recovery**: Discards input symbols until a synchronizing token is found.
   2. **Phrase Level Recovery**: Inserts or deletes symbols to repair the input locally.
   3. **Error Productions**: Adds productions specifically to handle common errors.
   4. **Global Correction**: Tries to find the closest correct string to the erroneous input.

---

### 9. **Structure of Lex Program**  
   ```
   %{ C declarations %}
   %%
   Regular_Expressions { Actions }
   %%
   { C code }
   ```
   - **Sections**: 
     1. **Declarations Section**: Place for C code and declarations.
     2. **Rules Section**: Maps regular expressions to actions.
     3. **C Code Section**: Contains any additional helper code.

---

### 10. **Significance of yywrap**  
   - **`yywrap()`** is a function in **Lex** that indicates the **end of input**. When it returns **1**, Lex assumes that the input is complete. This can be overridden to handle multiple input files.

---

### 11. **Significance of yyparse**  
   - **`yyparse()`** is the function generated by **Yacc** to start the parsing process. It reads tokens generated by **`yylex()`** and constructs the **parse tree** according to the grammar rules.

---

### 12. **Operations used on Grammar**  
   1. **Elimination of Left Recursion**  
   2. **Left Factoring**  
   3. **Augmenting Grammar** (adding a start symbol)  
   4. **Conversion to Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)**

---

### 13. **What is Kleene Closure?**  
   - **Kleene Closure** is a regular expression operator denoted by **`*`**, meaning **zero or more repetitions** of a pattern.  
     **Example:**  
     - `a*` matches `ε`, `a`, `aa`, `aaa`, etc.

---

### 14. **Difference between yylex and scanf**  
   - **`yylex()`** is the **token generator** function in Lex used during lexical analysis.  
   - **`scanf()`** reads input from the user. While `scanf()` reads data into variables, `yylex()` processes input into **tokens** used for parsing.

---

### 15. **What is Cross Compiler?**  
   - A **cross compiler** is a compiler that generates **executable code** for a platform **different** from the one on which the compiler is running.  
     **Example:**  
     - Compiling code on a Linux machine for an ARM-based embedded system.
